# Daycation
Day + Vacation = Daycation

<br />

## Motivation
The quarantine period we are facing due to the pandemic surely makes a lot of people bored. As people have more time than ever, it's hard to decide what to do when they're stuck in their house all the time. Pages like BuzzFeed usually have sugestions for boredom. However, do people really read those? And after reading those suggestion, does anyone actually do it?
Therefore, Daycation was born. 

<br />

## What it does
Counting on human' spontaneousness, Daycation only shows people only 1 suggestion at a time. Imagine Tinder but for activities. On Tinder, we swipe left or right based on our subconscious feelings. By suggesting only 1 activity at a time, we eliminate doubts and uncertainty in human' behaviour when making decision.

<b>Daycation helps people find activities to do and suggests real location to go. <br />Keeping safety in mind, our database only recommends suitable activites for social distancing.</b>

<br />

## How we built it
We use the decoupled architecture with NodeJS serving as the backend and simple HTML, CSS, JS as the frontend. We also use Yelp API for suggesting locations.

<br />

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The app is simple yet useful in making people's lives more fun!

<br />

## What's next for Daycation
Deployment as a mobile app will be the next goal.
